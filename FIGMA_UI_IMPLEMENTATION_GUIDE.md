# Figma UI Implementation Guide

## 🔗 **Alternative Approaches to Get Your Design**

Since I cannot directly access Figma links, here are the best ways to implement your design:

### **Option 1: Provide Screenshots**
1. Export/screenshot the key pages from your Figma design
2. Upload or describe the design elements
3. I can implement the components based on visual descriptions

### **Option 2: Describe Components**
Tell me what components you need:
- Navigation header with logo and menu items
- Hero section with call-to-action
- Cards for content display
- Form layouts
- Footer design
- Color scheme and typography

### **Option 3: Export Assets**
1. Export images/assets from Figma
2. Provide color codes and font specifications
3. Share layout specifications (spacing, grid, etc.)
